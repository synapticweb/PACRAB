## Overview

PACRAB (PHP ACRA backend) is a backend for the ACRA library (https://github.com/ACRA/acra) written in PHP. It makes use of Flight MVC framework (http://flightphp.com) and Propel ORM library (http://propelorm.org). The application is designed to be fully functional on shared hosting accounts with limited access rights.

## Requirements

PACRAB requires PHP 7.1 or higher. Any recent version of Apache web server or MySQL RDBMS should suffice. The reports generated by ACRA must use the `StringFormat.KEY_VALUE_LIST` format and must be sent via the HTTP POST method (see https://github.com/ACRA/acra/wiki/Report-Destinations for details).
